## Record of changes
- Create repo

## Big questions
- Should there be many workout rooms or one? 
- Should we try to avoid and kind of persistence?

## User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to see a list of available exercises
- As a user, I want to be able to add exercises. I must add reps to add the exercise.
- As a user viewing a workout room page, I want to be able to see which exercises are being performed and the number of reps I need to do to match the exercise leader.
- As a user, if I do more reps than the exercise leader, when I input my reps I should see that I become the leader. 
- As a user, I should be notified that I have been passed up by a new leader.
- Exercises should reset at midnight and be zeroed out. 

## Future Dreams
- persistence layer enabling analysis of past workout habits in sick graphs
- user accounts
- multiple workout rooms
    * workout room management system
- some form of proof of exercise completed? hm... (for the masses)
